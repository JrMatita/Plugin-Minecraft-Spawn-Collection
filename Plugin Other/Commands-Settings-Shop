This plugin implements two main commands: /buy and /sell. The /buy command allows players to purchase items from the store by specifying the item name and desired quantity. 
The command checks the prices from the map prices and deducts the cost from the player's balance. You should implement a getPlayerBalance function to get the player's balance,
a subtractPlayerBalance function to deduct the money from the player's balance.
The /sell command would allow you to sell items to the store, reversing the purchasing process. 
This command was not implemented in the example above, but you could do so following a similar approach to the /buy command
